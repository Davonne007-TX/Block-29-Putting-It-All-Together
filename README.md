#Block 29: Putting it all together

- The API
You can find the documentation for our "Puppy Bowl" API hereLinks to an external site.. You have seen this before, but it is a good idea to re-read through it to remember what routes are available to you to call, and what type of data you'll be working with in this project.

Summing It Up
Your job, as the web developer for a site like this, will be to handle the data about each of our puppy competitors and their owners. To that purpose, you'll be interacting with the "Puppy Bowl" API we've built that hosts the data you'll need about each puppy, each of their owners, and even the teams they are on. You will make certain requests to our API to get the appropriate data you'll need, save that to the state of your React app, and then build various React components to visually represent that state to your users.
